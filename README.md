# Finger-Counter-Open-CV
<h1>Creating a finger counter function in OpenCV involves:<h1/>
<p>
Preprocessing: Convert the image to grayscale, apply Gaussian blur, and use thresholding to create a binary image.
Contour Detection: Find contours in the binary image using findContours.
Convex Hull: Calculate the convex hull for each contour using convexHull.
Convexity Defects: Find convexity defects using convexityDefects to locate finger tips.
Count Fingers: Based on the number of defects and specific criteria, count and display the number of fingers in the image.
